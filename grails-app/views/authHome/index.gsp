                %{--<p class="lead justified">In order to stimulate rapid economic growth of the country, particularly through industrialization, the government has adopted an 'Open Door Policy' to attract foreign investment to Bangladesh. The BEPZA is the official organ of the government to promote, attract and facilitate foreign investment in the EPZs. Besides, BEPZA as the competent Authority performs inspection & supervision of the compliances of the enterprises related to social & environmental issues, safety & security at work place in order to maintain harmonious labor-management & industrial relations in EPZs. The primary objective of an EPZ is to provide special areas where potential investors would find a congenial investment climate free from cumbersome procedures.</p>--}%
                <p class="lead justified">The objective of the Income Support Program for the Poorest Project for Bangladesh is to provide income support to the poorest mothers in selected Upazilas, while (i) increasing the mothers use of child nutrition and cognitive development services, and (ii) enhancing local level government capacity to deliver safety nets. The project has three components. (1) Cash transfers for beneficiary mothers components will finance quarterly cash transfers to eligible households. (2) Enhancing local level government capacity component will provide the necessary inputs to Local Government Division (LGD) to facilitate the implementation of the proposed cash transfers. This will include strengthening the capacity of: (i) Union Parishads to develop the beneficiary list based on the Bangladesh Poverty Database (BPD) being developed by SID, and supervise their enrolment into ISPP; (ii) Community Clinics (CCs) to deliver the ANC and GMP services, and the CNCD awareness sessions; and (iii) Union Post Offices (UPOs) to make electronic payments to beneficiaries using the Postal Cash Cards (PCCs) upon compliance with co-responsibilities. (3) Monitoring and evaluation component will be critical to assess progress in achieving the projects objectives, and the impact of cash transfers on household poverty and on CNCD outcomes. This component will thus provide the necessary inputs to help LGD monitor ISPP beneficiary selection, enrolment, compliance with co-responsibilities, payments, case management as well as any grievances or appeals.</p>
